<h1 align="center">Solaris Ascension</h1>

<h3>How to Play</h3>
<p>Move your spaceship with either WASD or ARROW KEYS, shoot with SPACEBAR.</p>


<h3>Plan</h3>
<p>
I developed this game for the <a href="https://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/computer-gamedev-december-challenge-ends-december-31st/59069">December GameDev Challenge on FreeCodeCamp</a>, I drawn all the textures used(inspiration from google images), and wrote the code with ES6 in mind, it uses js classes(objects with multiple prototypes), and it is generally OOP, some functions seems really daunting as <code>move()</code> as it is the only movement function for all the different spaceships so it has a lot of if/else statements to determine the right ship, in the future when it will be split to make the code more modular. 
<br>
As of now the game has only one level with 3 different enemies each with their own unique movement and projectiles, in the future I plan to add:
<ul>
	<li>Player Upgrades</li>
	<li>New Enemies/Bosses</li>
	<li>New Levels</li>
	<li>Save/Load Game</li>
</ul>
